# Harvard Square Homeless Shelter
2018 Fall Jumbocode Project

## Project Description
Harvard Square Homeless Shelter has a Street Team (ST) that goes out to the streets of Cambridge and provide assistance to those in need who cannot make it to the shelter. A comprehensive history of all interactions need to be documented and consolidated. Currently, the ST data and notes system is fairly inefficient. The ST members take binders of resources and notepads out on the streets, and the notes are compiled at the end of the night. The app that we are building will streamline this process, and enable individual ST members to easily record and access information on any guest they have interacted with.
